This is for project 3.

The trajectory generator trims points using ray tracing through the obstacles -
it does a forward than backwards, unions them, then forward pass again.

The pathing is with continuous acceleration and velocity, and slows down on parts where the quadrotor must fly downwards. 

mymap.txt may need extra time, I ran it with extra time for my picture.
