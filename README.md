This is for project 3.

The trajectory generator trims points using ray tracing through the obstacles -
it does a forward than backwards, unions them, then forward pass again.

The pathing is kind of dumb and is just splines between waypoints with a constant velocity

mymap.txt may need extra time, I ran it with extra time for my picture.
